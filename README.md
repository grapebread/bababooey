# Bababooey Shell

Made by Shuprovo Sikder and Geoffrey Lin

## Features

- Read and run commands with arguments
- Cd and exit within the shell
- Read multiple commands using semicolons
- Multiple redirection through >, <, and >>
- Simple piping

## Unimplemented Features

- Would have liked to make it so that there wouldn't be spaces necessary for redirection (Ex: ls>yes) but couldn't.
- Multiple pipes

## Extra Features

- Most if not all cases for `cd` should be implemented but note the bugs below

## Bugs and Things to Know

- If you cd into a folder (x) and cd out of the parent folder (y) and you try to cd back into y it will cd into x.
  (it works on some computers but irreproducible bugs on others, we have no idea why)
- Sometimes cding fails. We have no clue why.
  (also might just be on Geoffrey's end)
- Piping and redirection still runs the end of the pipe (Ex: ls -a | cat > yes still prints out the cat and then redirects it into yes)
- Redirection requires at least one space between each argument
